# Java Raytracer
A simple 3D raytracer in Java. 

### NOTE
This program is not complete! It works partially, but is missing many features and optimizations, along with incomplete javadoc comments.

### Current Features
* Sphere, plane, and triangle mesh intersection algorithms
* .obj file parser
* Normal vector interpolation (Phong interpolation)
* Anti-aliasing
* Phong shading
* Transformable models and Camera
* Bounding sphere optimization

### Upcoming features
* Texture mapping
* Improved bounding sphere optimizations
* Recursion
* Reflection and refraction
* Animation support
